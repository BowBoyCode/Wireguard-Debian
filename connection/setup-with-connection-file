Got it! If you're using a `.connection` file instead of a `.conf` file, you can still follow similar steps to ensure your keys are stored securely and have the correct permissions. Here's how you can do it:

### Storing WireGuard Keys
1. **Location**: Store your keys in a secure directory, such as `/etc/wireguard/`.
2. **Permissions**: Set the correct permissions to prevent unauthorized access:
   ```sh
   sudo mkdir -p /etc/wireguard
   sudo chmod 700 /etc/wireguard
   sudo touch /etc/wireguard/privatekey /etc/wireguard/publickey
   sudo chmod 600 /etc/wireguard/privatekey
   sudo chmod 644 /etc/wireguard/publickey
   ```

### Generating WireGuard Keys with Correct Permissions
1. **Generate Keys**: Use the `wg` command to generate your private and public keys, ensuring you set the correct permissions immediately:
   ```sh
   cd /etc/wireguard
   umask 077
   wg genkey | tee privatekey | wg pubkey > publickey
   ```

2. **Verify Permissions**: Check that the permissions are set correctly:
   ```sh
   ls -l /etc/wireguard
   ```

### Configuring NetworkManager with a .connection File
1. **Import Configuration**: Import your WireGuard configuration into NetworkManager using your `.connection` file:
   ```sh
   nmcli connection import type wireguard file /path/to/your/file.connection
   ```

2. **Activate Connection**: Activate the WireGuard connection using NetworkManager:
   ```sh
   nmcli connection up <connection-name>
   ```

Replace `<connection-name>` with the name of your WireGuard connection as specified in your `.connection` file.

By following these steps, you can securely store your WireGuard keys and configure NetworkManager using your `.connection` file.
